This project is a basic bookmark server built during the Udacity
"Full Stack Web Dev" program.

The server leverages Python's http.server and requests plugins to allow
visitors to add shortened names and store bookmarks on the server.


The server is hosted on Heroku, and it volatile - when reset it will lose
the bookmarks that have been created.
